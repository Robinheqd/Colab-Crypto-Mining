# Colab-Crypto-Mining
My Cryptocurrency Mining Experiments on Google CoLab Notebooks

This Repository is under rapid construction. Here, I'll be sharing the Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed on Google CoLabs. 
Here I accept the fact that the Google CoLabs are actually meant to deploy and train Machine Learning and Data Analysis stuffs.
But as someone who advocates for the freedom of knowledge through experimentation, I consider it a worth try for everyone. 
And above all, its not something deployed permenently (Google CoLabs sessions have a maximum lifespan of 12 hours).

So, Happy Coding
